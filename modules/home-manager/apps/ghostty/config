# The font families to use.
# 
# You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
# 
#     ghostty +list-fonts
# 
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
# 
# Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always use
# Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji. You can
# override this behavior by specifying a font family here that contains
# emoji glyphs.
# 
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If a stylistic variant is not
# found, Ghostty will use the regular style. This prevents falling back to a
# different font family just to get a style such as bold. This also applies
# if you explicitly specify a font family for a style. For example, if you
# set `font-family-bold = FooBar` and "FooBar" cannot be found, Ghostty will
# use whatever font is set for `font-family` for the bold style.
# 
# Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
# For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
# italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
# applying a slant to the regular style. If you want to disable these
# synthesized styles then you can use the `font-style` configurations
# as documented below.
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
# 
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
# 
#     font-family = ""
#     font-family = "My Favorite Font"
# 
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
font-family = BerkeleyMonoVariable Nerd Font

# Apply a font feature. This can be repeated multiple times to enable multiple
# font features. You can NOT set multiple font features with a single value
# (yet).
# 
# The font feature will apply to all fonts rendered by Ghostty. A future
# enhancement will allow targeting specific faces.
# 
# A valid value is the name of a feature. Prefix the feature with a `-` to
# explicitly disable it. Example: `ss20` or `-ss20`.
# 
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical
# feature name for programming ligatures. To look into what font features
# your font has and what they do, use a font inspection tool such as
# [fontdrop.info](https://fontdrop.info).
# 
# To generally disable most ligatures, use `-calt`, `-liga`, and `-dlig` (as
# separate repetitive entries in your config).
font-feature = -calt,-dlig,-liga

# Font size in points. This value can be a non-integer and the nearest integer
# pixel size will be selected. If you have a high dpi display where 1pt = 2px
# then you can get an odd numbered pixel size by specifying a half point.
# 
# For example, 13.5pt @ 2px/pt = 27px
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals,
# i.e. new windows, tabs, etc. Note that you may still not see the change
# depending on your `window-inherit-font-size` setting. If that setting is
# true, only the first window will be affected by this change since all
# subsequent windows will inherit the font size of the previous window.

# The style of the cursor. This sets the default style. A running program can
# still request an explicit cursor style using escape sequences (such as `CSI
# q`). Shell configurations will often request specific cursor styles.
# 
# Note that shell integration will automatically set the cursor to a bar at
# a prompt, regardless of this configuration. You can disable that behavior
# by specifying `shell-integration-features = no-cursor` or disabling shell
# integration entirely.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * `block`
#   * `bar`
#   * `underline`
#   * `block_hollow`
# 
cursor-style = block

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.

# Key bindings. The format is `trigger=action`. Duplicate triggers will
# overwrite previously set values.
# 
# Trigger: `+`-separated list of keys and modifiers. Example: `ctrl+a`,
# `ctrl+shift+b`, `up`. Some notes:
# 
#   * modifiers cannot repeat, `ctrl+ctrl+a` is invalid.
# 
#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
# 
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
# 
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
# 
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
# 
# You may also specify multiple triggers separated by `>` to require a
# sequence of triggers to activate the action. For example,
# `ctrl+a>n=new_window` will only trigger the `new_window` action if the
# user presses `ctrl+a` followed separately by `n`. In other software, this
# is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a key table, etc. There
# is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
# 
# Warning: if you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
# you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
# in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
# 
# A trigger sequence has some special handling:
# 
#   * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
#     the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
#     force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
#     specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
#     press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.
# 
#   * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
#     override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
#     `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
#     will do nothing.
# 
#   * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
#     used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
#     sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
#     `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.
# 
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
# 
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
# 
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
# 
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
# 
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
# 
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
# 
# Some notes for the action:
# 
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
# 
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for
# keybind:
# 
#   * `keybind=clear` will clear all set keybindings. Warning: this
#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default
#     keybindings.
# 
# A keybind by default causes the input to be consumed. This means that the
# associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the running program
# in the terminal. If you wish to send the encoded value to the program,
# specify the "unconsumed:" prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
# "unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config"
keybind = ctrl+d=scroll_page_fractional:0.5
keybind = ctrl+u=scroll_page_fractional:-0.5

# The style of the macOS titlebar. Available values are: "native",
# "transparent", "tabs", and "hidden".
# 
# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
# 
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
# 
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
# 
# The "hidden" style hides the titlebar. Unlike `window-decoration = false`,
# however, it does not remove the frame from the window or cause it to have
# squared corners. Changing to or from this option at run-time may affect
# existing windows in buggy ways. The top titlebar area of the window will
# continue to drag the window around and you will not be able to use
# the mouse for terminal events in this space.
# 
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
# 
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.
macos-titlebar-style = tabs

# If true, Ghostty will show a graphical indication when secure input is
# enabled. This indication is generally recommended to know when secure input
# is enabled.
# 
# Normally, secure input is only active when a password prompt is displayed
# or it is manually (and typically temporarily) enabled. However, if you
# always have secure input enabled, the indication can be distracting and
# you may want to disable it.
macos-secure-input-indication = true

# When enabled, the full GTK titlebar is displayed instead of your window
# manager's simple titlebar. The behavior of this option will vary with your
# window manager.

# under macOS.
# 
# Changing this value at runtime and reloading the configuration will only
# affect new windows.

# If `true` (default), Ghostty will enable libadwaita theme support. This
# will make `window-theme` work properly and will also allow Ghostty to
# properly respond to system theme changes, light/dark mode changing, etc.
# This requires a GTK4 desktop with a GTK4 theme.
# 
# If you are running GTK3 or have a GTK3 theme, you may have to set this
# to false to get your theme picked up properly. Having this set to true
# with GTK3 should not cause any problems, but it may not work exactly as
# expected.
# 
# This configuration only has an effect if Ghostty was built with
# libadwaita support.
